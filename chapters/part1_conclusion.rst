Conclusion Part I - Benefits of a factory
=========================================

-  All initialization is explicit, at the cost of being verbose.
-  Type-Safe
-  Minimal public interface
-  No “polluting” the global name space with local variables that are
   used for clarity or or building things
-  Injecting/replacing services for Edge-To-Edge testing
-  Code as configuration - if you can read PHP, you can understand
   what's going on.
-  Deferred initialization
