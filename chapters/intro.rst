What is this book about?
========================
This book intends to show you how to write high-quality code and to teach
you the concepts and pitfalls of the factory and dependency injection
container patters from first principles. Through the course of the book,
we'll evolve a simple "To-Do" list application from a collection of
spaghetti code to a Symfony application.

The book takes inspiration from the Symfony documentation 
"`Create your own PHP Framework
<https://symfony.com/doc/current/create_framework/index.html>`_", but has
a stronger focus on the factory and dependency injection patterns and
shows how to separate "framework" from "core domain". In the first part,
we will not use any external libraries.

What is "high-quality code"? At the level of classes, this means adhering
to the so-called SOLID-Principles. At the level of the application, this
means using the so-called "Clean Architecture" (also known as "Hexagonal
Architecture" or "Ports and Adapters"). The book will explain those
concepts briefly with examples.


Who is this book for?
=====================
PHP novices and people who want to peek behind the curtain of PHP web
frameworks, wanting to understand how they evolved and what problems they
solve.
