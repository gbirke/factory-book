What is this book about?
========================
This book intends to show you how to write high-quality code and to teach
you the concepts and pitfalls of the factory and dependency injection
container patters from first principles. Through the course of the book,
we'll evolve a simple "To-Do" list application from a collection of
spaghettti code to a Symfony application. 

Who is this book for?
=====================
PHP novices and people who want to peek behind the curtain of PHP web
frameworks, wanting to understand how they evolved and what problems they
solve.
